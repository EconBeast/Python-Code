# Python-Code
This will serve two purposes: 
(1) an illustrative purpose: documenting/commenting methodologies I have learned as my time as an RA. Put precisely, the code will reflect mostly data management using pandas. 

(2) just notes: code on material I am learning about actively or from classes that I am taking.
