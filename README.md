# Python-Code
This will serve two purposes: 

(1) an illustrative purpose: documenting/commenting methodologies I have learned as my time as an RA (mostly pandas). Nevertheless, I'd like to exhaust all tools that effectively extract and present information from data.  

(2) just notes: code on material I am learning about actively or from classes that I am taking.
